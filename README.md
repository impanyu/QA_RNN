 Prerequisites
-------------

- Python 2.7+
- [Tensorflow 1.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
 
 
Usage
-----

To train a model from scratch (ifcontinue==False indicates this is a new model, data_type is the type of the tasks you want to train on and is between 1-20)

    $ python QAtrain_weights.py --data_path=./tasks_1-20_v1-2/en/ --model=small --ifcontinue=False --data_type=1
    
To train a model from scratch (ifcontinue==True indicates continuing to train an existing model, data_type is the type of the tasks you want to train on and is between 1-20)

   $ python QAtrain_weights.py --data_path=./tasks_1-20_v1-2/en/ --model=small --ifcontinue=False --data_type=1
   
To test an existing model (data_type is the type of the tasks and is between 1-20):

   $ python QAanswer.py --data_path=./tasks_1-20_v1-2/en/ --model=small --data_type=1
